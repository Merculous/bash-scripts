# Update-and-make

This is works by updating all directories which contain a .git folder, and then compiles every other folder in a directory.

As above follows, here's an example.

Parent folder (In my case, Documents)

 - Update if .git is present
 - Compile with given statements
 - Done :D

# tar_xz_pv

NOTE: The binary "pv" is needed to handle the progress bar, and any other visual data.

This script was just something to figure out how to work with stdin, stdout,
stderr. I think I've learned a lot. I haven't looked into it much before, so I
have some sort of understanding of how they work.
